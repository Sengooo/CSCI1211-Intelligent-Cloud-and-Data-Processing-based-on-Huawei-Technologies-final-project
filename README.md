# Booking Clone — Team Backend Project (Django + DRF + PostgreSQL)

This repository contains our team backend project: a simplified booking service API.
The project is built for university practice and is organized as incremental modules
(properties, users/auth, bookings, reviews, logging).

---

## 1. Project Goal

The goal of this project is to learn how to design a real backend service in stages:

- model domain entities in Django ORM
- expose REST API with Django REST Framework
- work with PostgreSQL as the main DB
- use team workflow with feature branches and pull requests

Think of the project as a constructor:

- models = "what data we store"
- serializers = "how data is transformed to/from JSON"
- viewsets = "what actions API supports"
- router/urls = "where endpoints are available"

---

## 2. Implemented Module in This Branch: City

### 2.1 Business requirement

Entity: `City`

Fields:

- `name` — `CharField`
- `country` — `CharField`
- `created_at` — `DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)`

Constraint:

- pair `name + country` must be unique

### 2.2 Why this uniqueness rule is important

City names are not globally unique (`Paris` can exist in different countries),
but duplicate cities inside the same country should be blocked.

Examples:

- `Paris, France` + `Paris, USA` -> valid
- `Paris, France` + `Paris, France` -> invalid

---

## 3. Architecture of the City API

```
HTTP request
    |
    v
URL Router (/api/cities/...)
    |
    v
CityViewSet (CRUD actions)
    |
    v
CitySerializer (validation + JSON transform)
    |
    v
City model (ORM) <-> PostgreSQL
```

### Layer responsibilities

- **Model**: schema and DB constraints
- **Serializer**: input/output validation and representation
- **ViewSet**: REST actions (`list/create/retrieve/update/destroy`)
- **Router**: endpoint registration

---

## 4. Tech Stack

- Python 3.14+
- Django 6.0.2
- Django REST Framework 3.16.1
- PostgreSQL 14+
- `python-dotenv`, `python-decouple`
- `psycopg` (PostgreSQL driver)

## 6. Environment Setup (Step-by-Step)

### 6.1 Clone and enter project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/5ar1ja/booking-clone.git
cd booking-clone/booking_clone
```

### 6.2 Create and activate virtual environment

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### 6.3 Install dependencies

```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install python-decouple "psycopg[binary]"
```

---

## 7. PostgreSQL Setup (macOS + Homebrew)

### 7.1 Start PostgreSQL service

```bash
brew services start postgresql@14
pg_isready -h localhost -p 5432
```

Expected result:

```text
localhost:5432 - accepting connections
```

### 7.2 Create DB role and database

```bash
psql -d postgres -c "DO \$\$ BEGIN IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT FROM pg_catalog.pg_roles WHERE rolname='booking_user') THEN CREATE ROLE booking_user LOGIN PASSWORD 'booking_pass_123'; END IF; END \$\$;"

if ! psql -d postgres -tAc "SELECT 1 FROM pg_database WHERE datname='booking_clone_db'" | grep -q 1; then
  createdb -O booking_user booking_clone_db
fi

psql -d postgres -c "GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE booking_clone_db TO booking_user;"
```

### 7.3 Verify role and DB

```bash
psql -d postgres -c "\\du booking_user"
psql -d postgres -c "\\l booking_clone_db"
```

---

## 8. Environment Variables (`.env`)

Create `.env` from template:

```bash
cp .example.env .env
```

Set values:

```env
SECRET_KEY=dev-secret-key-123
DJANGORLAR_ENV_ID=local

DB_NAME=booking_clone_db
DB_USER=booking_user
DB_PASSWORD=booking_pass_123
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
```

---

## 9. Run Project

```bash
python manage.py check
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver
```

App URLs:

- Admin: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/`
- API root (City): `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/cities/`

---

## 10. City API Documentation

Base URL: `/api/cities/`

### 10.0 Available endpoints (quick list)

- `GET /api/cities/` - list cities
- `POST /api/cities/` - create city
- `GET /api/cities/{id}/` - retrieve city
- `PUT /api/cities/{id}/` - full update
- `PATCH /api/cities/{id}/` - partial update
- `DELETE /api/cities/{id}/` - delete city

### 10.1 Create city

`POST /api/cities/`

Request:

```json
{
  "name": "Almaty",
  "country": "Kazakhstan"
}
```

Response `201`:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "Almaty",
  "country": "Kazakhstan",
  "created_at": "2026-03-11T16:45:00.123456Z"
}
```

### 10.2 List cities

`GET /api/cities/`

Response `200`:

```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Almaty",
    "country": "Kazakhstan",
    "created_at": "2026-03-11T16:45:00.123456Z"
  }
]
```

### 10.3 Retrieve city by id

`GET /api/cities/{id}/`

### 10.4 Update city

`PATCH /api/cities/{id}/`

Request:

```json
{
  "name": "Astana"
}
```

### 10.5 Delete city

`DELETE /api/cities/{id}/`

### 10.6 Validation behavior

If duplicate (`name`, `country`) is sent, DB unique constraint prevents insert/update.
API returns validation/DB error response (4xx).

---

## 11. Team Workflow (Git)

We use feature branches and pull requests.

Typical flow:

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feature/<task-name>
# code changes
# tests/checks
git add .
git commit -m "Meaningful commit message"
git push -u origin feature/<task-name>
```

Then open PR to `main` and request review.

---

## 13. Troubleshooting

### Problem: `AUTH_USER_MODEL refers to model 'auths.User'` / `'auths.CustomUser'`

Reason: app `auths` is not installed in current branch.

Fix for this branch:

```python
AUTH_USER_MODEL = "auth.User"
```

### Problem: `pg_isready` shows `no response`

Check service and logs:

```bash
brew services list | grep -i postgres
tail -n 80 /opt/homebrew/var/log/postgresql@14.log
```

If `postgresql.conf` is missing:

```bash
cp /opt/homebrew/var/postgresql@14/postgresql.conf.bak /opt/homebrew/var/postgresql@14/postgresql.conf
brew services restart postgresql@14
```

If syntax error near `log_t imezone`:

```bash
perl -pi -e 's/^log_t\s+imezone\s*=/log_timezone =/' /opt/homebrew/var/postgresql@14/postgresql.conf
brew services restart postgresql@14
```

## 14. Verification Checklist

Before creating PR:

- `python manage.py check` passes
- migrations are created and applied
- `/api/cities/` returns `200`
- create/update/delete city works
- duplicate `(name, country)` is rejected

---

## 15. Next Steps

Planned backend expansion:

- connect City to apartments/properties entities
- authentication and permissions per endpoint
- booking flow with status transitions
- reviews module with rating aggregation
- centralized logging and monitoring

---

## Team Note

This documentation is maintained by the team and updated per branch scope.
When a module is merged to `main`, README sections should be synchronized accordingly.

## 16. Final Project: Cloud & Data Processing

This section documents the fulfillment of the Final Project requirements for the "Intelligent Cloud & Data Processing" course, focusing on the frontend architecture and Docker containerization.

### 16.1 Frontend Architecture (Vue.js + Vite)

The frontend is built as a Single Page Application (SPA) using **Vue.js** and **Vite**. The codebase is located in the `booking-frontend` directory.

**Key Features Implemented on the Frontend:**
- **Vue Router**: Client-side routing to navigate between pages.
- **State Management**: Centralized store for user authentication and session state (`/stores/auth.js`).
- **API Integration**: Service layer to communicate seamlessly with the Django REST API (`/services/api.js`).
- **Views & Components**:
  - `LoginView.vue` & `RegisterView.vue`: Secure user authentication flows.
  - `ApartmentsView.vue`: Listing and filtering available properties.
  - `ApartmentDetailView.vue`: Detailed view of a specific property.
  - `MyApartmentsView.vue`: Dashboard for hosts to manage their property listings.
  - `BookingsView.vue`: Interface for managing reservations and checking booking statuses.

### 16.2 Containerization (Docker Architecture)

To ensure consistency across development and deployment environments, the entire application has been containerized using **Docker** and orchestrated with **Docker Compose**.

**Multi-Container Setup (`docker-compose.yml`):**

1. **Web (Django Backend)**:
   - Built from the root `Dockerfile` using Python.
   - Exposes port `8000`.
   - Volume-mounted for hot-reloading during local development (`./booking_clone:/app`).
   - Connected to Redis for caching, celery tasks, and session management.

2. **Frontend (Vue.js)**:
   - Built from `booking-frontend/Dockerfile` using a lightweight `node:22-alpine` base image.
   - Exposes Vite's default port `5173`.
   - Uses bind mounts (`volumes`) to sync local source code while preserving the container's `node_modules` for instant updates without rebuilding.
   - Configured with `depends_on: web` to ensure the backend is initialized first.

3. **Redis**:
   - Uses the official `redis:7-alpine` image.
   - Exposes port `6379`.
   - Persistent data storage configured via Docker volumes (`redis_data`).

**Running the Application via Docker:**
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```
- **Frontend** will be accessible at: `http://localhost:5173`
- **Backend API** will be available at: `http://localhost:8000/api/`

### 16.3 Deployment Preparation
The application is fully containerized and decoupled, fulfilling the core requirements. It is ready to be deployed to cloud platforms (such as Render, Railway, AWS, or Huawei Cloud) using the provided Dockerfiles and container configurations.
